# Templates

No template engine is used, we don't need these shits to build a motherfucking static website. Templates are pure PHP.

## The files

If you cloned the repository, you already have:
- `layout.php`
- `index.php`
- `post.php`

If you downloaded only the script, it will download the default template files if no `templates` dir is found at the root of your project.

You can create an optional `page.php` file to display your pages. `post.php` will be used by default.

## Variables

Templates are very customizable. Each template always receive the following variables:
- `(array) $config`: what do you think it is?
- `(array) $messages`: the translation messages (english and french)

Also, templates receive specific data:

### `layout.php`:
- `$body`: the rendered content of the `post.php` or `page.php`

### `post.php` and `page.php`:
- `(array) $post` , which contains (all strings) :
  - `title`: maybe it's the title
  - `content`: self-explanatory
  - `url`: the local url to the page/post (it's not a permalink)
  - `pathname`: for technical reasons, you should not need it
  - `next`: the next post (without next/previous)
  - `previous`: the previous post (without next/previous)

### `index.php`:
- `(array) $posts`: an array of all posts on the page
- `(?string) $previous_url`: url to the previous page (null on first page)
- `(?string) $next_url`: url to the next page (null on last page)
- `(int) $total_index_pages`: total number of index pages
- `(int) $current_page`: the number of the current page
- `(array) $pagination`: an array with the pages to display in the pagination

## Pagination

The `$pagination` variable contains the minimum required to build a pagination, that is, an array with the pages numbers. `null` items represent an ellipsis. Example:
```
[1, 2, 3, null, 6, 7,8]
```
other variables available allow to build a pagination nav.

The rules are:
- the first 3 and last 3 pages are always returned
- the current page is returned with `$config['pages_around]` pages around (obviously)
 

## Helpers

### Excerpt
`excerpt(string $html, int $limit = 50, string $suffix = 'â€¦'): string`

Use it to no display the whole post on index page (used in default template).

### Index url
`index_url(int $page_num): string`

Simply returns the url to given index page.
